<H2>Community Detection In Graphs</H2>
<p>
Interactions in online social networks, communication networks can be naturally modeled as graphs. Structural communities in graphs generally defined as groups of highly connected vertices/nodes in the graph. This groups generally represent similar interest groups, friend communities etc.  
<br>
Finding communities in large graphs is a very useful technique when trying to narrow down analytics to smaller targeted groups.This can be used for online marketing, online surveillance etc. 
<br>
Detecting communities in graphs is computationally very expensive, specially for large graphs.

<H2>Parallel Algorithm For Fast Community Detection</H2>
<p>
This document provides a quick guide to setting up and running our parallel implementation for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/">Louvain community detection method</a> to detect non overlapping communities in large graphs . 
<br>
Lovain community detection method detect communities in a graph in a hierarchical manner. At each level detected communities are reduced to vertices, reducing the graph size. This enable zoom in and out of high level communities.

<H2>Quick Start With Development VM</H2>

Our distributed memory parallel implementation of Louvain community detection based on MPI 2.0 runtime environemnt. Following instrcutions guide you through how to run a this on a sample graph to detect communities.

Pre installed virtual machine is used in this guide which can be installed in your local machine. 

<H3>Download Virtual Machine</H3>
<p> Download the pre installed virtual machine from <a href="http://losangeles.usc.edu/usc-cloud/goffish/parallel-louvain-mpi.zip">here</a>
</p>

<H3>Setting up</H3>
<p>
Install Oracle Virtual Box 4.3.8. You can download it from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3">here</a>.

Install and configure Vagrant<br>
<code>sudo apt-get install vagrant</code>
<br>
Add Vagrant plugin that keeps Virtual Box Guest Additions in sync.<br>
<code>vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest</code>
<br>
Extract the downloaded virtual machine<br>

Go to the virtual machine directory and start the environment<br>
<code>vagrant up</code><br>
<br>
After it boots, log in to the VM<br>
<code>vagrant ssh</code><br>
<br>
Other useful vagrant commands:<br>
<code>vagrant suspend</code><br>
Saves the current running state of the machine and stops it. vagrant up will resume.

<code>vagrant halt</code><br>
Gracefully shuts down the vm. vagrant up will boot it back up.
<br>
<code>vagrant destroy</code>
<br>
Destroys the vm (and all the cruft inside of it). vagrant up will reprovision and run the deploy scripts again.
<br>

<H3>Running The Sample</H3>
<p>
Log in to the virtual machine
<code>vagrant ssh</code><br>

Source code is and sample data sets are located in /vagrant/code/louvain-mpi directory.
<code>cd /vagrant/code/louvain-mpi</code><br>

A Sample small graph is located in this directory.
*4elt.txt - graph in edge list format. 
*4elt.graph - graph in metis graph format. 
<br>
First step of execution is partitioning the graph and creating the graph partitions for parallel louvain algorithm. This is done using converter-script.sh
<code>./converter-script.sh</code><br>

Executing this will compile the source code, partition the graph into 2 partitions and create graph partitions.

Executing this will compile the source code, partition the graph into 2 partitions and create graph partitions.<br>
To Run the the parallel louvain algorithm run the run-louvain.sh script <br>
<code>./run-louvain.sh</code>

Executing this script with run the algorithm in two MPI processors and output the community graph at 2nd level of louvain method to level2.txt 
<br>
level2.txt contains the graph in adjacency list format.
each line is in following format
source: (sink1 weight1) (sink2 weight2) â€¦ (sinkN weightN)

<code>
